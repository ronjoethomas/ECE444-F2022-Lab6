**Pros and Cons of TDD:**

TDD has many pros when it comes to making sure the expectations of a deliverable are very clear. By defining test cases first, you are forced to fully define what the functionality of your task will be. This can save time during implementation as your expectations will not be ambiguous. TDD also supports modularized programming design as you are expected to create test cases for each subcomponent. This helps with maintainability of your code as each component will be self contained. Furthermore, TDD helps to reduce debugging time of your code as you will be testing every subcomponent and validating their functionality frequently.

TDD also has a few cons that may make it non ideal for certain situations. One disadvantage is that TDD will require more time as you need to define the testcases very clearly. This may be not feasible for projects with very tight deadlines. Furthermore, if you are working on a project where the requirements are not fully defined/constantly changing, TDD might not be the best approach as you will constantly have to keep redesigning the test case. Lastly, if you have any bugs in the test case, it will be very difficult to find.
